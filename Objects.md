# Objects

- Go language is weakly object-oriented.
- Object-oriented programming really for for code organization. You organize your code by encapsulating your code.
- You group together data and functions which are related.
- Create a user-defined type which is specific to an application.
    Ex: ints have data(number of value) and functions(addition). Object-oriented programming is the same idea. You are creating types. specific to applications.

## Object example
- Implementing an application performing geometry in 3D.
- Many functions will operate on points.
- Each point has some data x,y and z coords.
- Points also have **functions** :DistToOrigin(), Quadrant()
- Point **class** defines data and functions. a general template.
- Point **objects** are instances of class. actual values.

## Objects in Go
**structs**
- No inheritance
- No constructors
- No generics
- Easier to code
